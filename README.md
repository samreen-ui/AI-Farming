Here is the full source code of AI Farming Application that includes various predictions
1)Rainfall prediciton(ML using random forest regression)
2)Yield predition(ML using random forest regression)
3)Crop recommendation(ML using random forest regression)
4)Real view satellite imaginary mapping using GEE and finding the land classification(Deep Learning using inception V3 model)
5)Crop classification(Deep Learning using inception V3 model)
These repo includes the all the machine learning models that are well accuracy to make predictions
and using flask api to make the connection between the MLDL models and the frontend-react native.
